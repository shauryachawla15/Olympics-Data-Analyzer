# Olympics-Data-Analyzer
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a sample dataset of Olympic athletes, their sports, countries, and medals using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
It demonstrates how to perform data analysis, grouping, and visualization in Python, focusing on medal tallies, athlete performance, and trends over time.

The project is designed as a mini data analytics dashboard and can be extended with real-world Olympic datasets.

🚀 Features

🥇 Medal tally by country (bar chart)
👑 Top athletes by medal count
📊 Average medals per Olympic Games
🏋️ Medal distribution by sport (pie chart)
📈 Medal trends over the years (line chart using pivot table)
💾 Export processed results to CSV

🛠️ Tech Stack
